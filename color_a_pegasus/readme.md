## LEARN PHASER BASICS: COLOR A PEGASUS
### Review
Congratulations! You made your first game, Color a Pegasus! Over the course of this lesson you created the sequence of event handlers to:

* Own and update the state of the game.
* Update the color of specific parts of the pegasus in the game
* Highlight GameObjects to indicate what will be clicked on
* Youâ€™ve displayed a lot of control over the possible mouse cursor events and successfully used that control to build a coloring game! Good job!

### Instructions
If you want to build on this game think about ways you could:

1. Add a new color to the palette.
2. Color in the background as well as the pegasus.
3. Put the palette on the top, or down the side of the game.
4. Color in a set of different shapes that you supply (you can use sprites or images instead of curves built into Phaser).
5. Add music.
6. Anything else you come up with to update and improve the game!
